#Todo (zack): Optimize worflow (save ci run time)
# -> Possibilities :
# - Refactor the steps into separate jobs to optimize the build time
# - Publish a container w/ pre-installed npm dependencies
# - Find a way to cache angular builds
on:
  push:
    # Context : We don't have the feature of protected branches
    # The workflow we're aiming for :
    # - No one have direct commit access to develop branch
    # - The only way to contribute to `develop` is by merging pull requests
    # - The merge must be guarded by prior CI checks
    # -> We want to trigger workflows on develop [pull requests,push]
    # by skipping push runs coming from merged pull requests
